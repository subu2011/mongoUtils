There is many a times requirement to move or copy

Rows between one collection/table to another in applications

While this can be done easily in RDBMS I was not able to found 

a simple utility to do the same in MongoDB 

This is a utility to do either move or copy in MongoDB

I had tested this with Node 12, MongoDB 3.2 and Monk driver

But should work mostly with any recent version of node/noSQL i think

Using closure  to prevent different validate and operation inputs

Please feel free to customize,add validations exception handling etc to suit your needs
